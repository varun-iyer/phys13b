a. The plot is in data.png, and its fourier transform is in fourier.png. The fourier transform shows that the dominant frequency is 120 Hz.
b. It took about 8 seconds to run (as opposed to the usual two) and it can't be trusted. The program works by taking a sample, waiting until the sample spacing time has elapsed, and repeating these two steps until an adequate number of samples is taken. If the sample spacing time is less than the time it takes to transmit and store a data point, the computer will just not wait before starting the next sample. Because of the way that it determines the terminating condition, it will just take as much time as it needs to capture the neecessary number of data points without regard to the time, which is what has occured.
