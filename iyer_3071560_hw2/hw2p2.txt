a. You can apply at most 4V.
b. The minimum applicable voltage is GND-0.3V.
c. Because adcdemo uses the FST 4.096V, the differential input impedance is 15MOhm.
d. You can draw as much as 25 mA, so itâ€™s not the end of the world if you
	exceed 1mA.  I found this in section 5.1 on page 19.
e. The maximum setting of the MCP in this case is 3.3V, according to the 
	maximum voltage in section 5.1.
	V=IR so the resistive load is V/I = 3.3/1mA = 3.3 * 10^3 = 3.3 kOhms.
