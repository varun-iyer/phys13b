The numbers change with the accelerometer's motion. There is a constant measured acceleration of ~10 m/s^2 which is due to gravity. Acceleration in the direction of the axis drawn on the accelerometer increases the displayed values and in the opposite direction decreases it. In the Z axis (assuming the acccelerometer is oriented with the printed Z facing up), moving the accelerometer down brings the values closer to zero and up increases the values. These phenomena are different to observe because the range of motion is limited, so any acceleration in a direction needs to be complemented by a deceleration not to soon after, so it is necessary to pause the output during the acceleration to observe the values properly.
If the accelerometer is turned upside down, the Z-axis values become negative.
