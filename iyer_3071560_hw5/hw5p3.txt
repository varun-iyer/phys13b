a. At the beginning of my program in hw5p3a.py, I have a short calibration period for the accelerometer to determine a standard deviation of the norms which is representative of the data and identify the direction of gravity.
After this is determined, the accelerometer can detect when it is stationary, because the standard deviation of the vector norms will be loosely equal to the standard deviation representative of stationary data. When the accelerometer detects that it is stationary, it sets the gravity vector to the current measurement.
This isn’t a perfect solution as it does not account for turns during motion and takes a couple milliseconds to register that the accelerometer is stationary. However I don’t think that a perfect solution is possible without additional hardware; there are always ‘aliasing’ situations in which the same measured acceleration could have been measured with a different gravitational orientation.
b. Because I was already saving the data the boxcar was a pretty straightforward implementation, found in hw5p3b.py.
