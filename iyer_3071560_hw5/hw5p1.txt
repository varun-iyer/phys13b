The LED goes back and forth from on to off, transitioning slowly. On the oscilloscope, we see a square wave with the duty cycle changing from 0 to 100% and bacak again. The code write a particular PWM duty cycle to the pin with `wiringpi.pwmWrite`, waits for five milliseconds, increases the duty cycle, and writes the new duty cycle to the pin. It repeats the processes in reverse, decreasing the duty cycle slowly to return it to zero. This explains the oscilloscope's display of the duty cycle increasing and decreasing repeatedly. The oscilloscope measures the frequency as 36.23 kHz.
