a. The heater has a resistance of 3.6 Ohms and a voltage of 11.63V. The current through the heater is equal to V/R, or 3.23A. The power being dissapated is equal to IV, or 3.571 W.
b. Measuring from the low heater terminal to the low capacitor termimnal, the voltage is 1.7V. Assuming LED current is negligible, the current through the MOSFET must be 3.23A * 0.310V = 1.00W. This seems ridiculous to me, but appears consistent with normal operation based on the datasheet.
