a. The DAC updates the voltage every 1.08ms. The code is in `hw4p2a.py`.
b. I saw the delay actually go down to 480 microseconds with three videos playing. I have a hypothesis as to why we see this decrease, which seems contrary to our intuitions that more processes = less resources = higher latency. In order to make IO processes (like dialout processes and UI processes) more responsive, the Linux scheduler prioritizes them over processor-only processes and gives them longer contiguous periods of execution rather than many smaller periods. Itâ€™s possible that these measurements were made during a contiguous period, resulting in a perceived decrease of DAC latency.
c. I saw the period to be 1.04ms, not a significant reduction; I suspect that I2C IO is the limiting computation, and not the `sin` calculation. The code is in `hw4p2c.py`.
d. The update interval is now 1.104. I hypothesize that I2C is really the limiting factor, and not the additional function call.
