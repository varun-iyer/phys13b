In order to calibrate, I am ensuring that the all data in the past five seconds is within 0.1C of the setpoint, and then averaging the last two seconds of RTD readings (in order to compensate for the phase shift) and also the last five seconds of resistor readings. It doesn't matter that we may actually be taking data as far as 0.1C from the cetpoint and also possible phase shifted as long as the data is consistent, and represents nearly the same underlying temperature.
