a. The oscillations at 35C, 100% duty were at about 2.7 Celsius. At 3% duty, the oscillations were about 0.1 Celsius.
b. The highest attaiable temperature at 3% duty was 321.7 K.
c. I created a binary "search" program to identify the duty cycles which minimize oscillations for 30 and 60 Celsius. The program reaches a temperature with a duty cycle of 100% and waits for the block to return to the setpoint. Then, it attempts to hold it at the setpoint with a given duty cycle and identifies the maximum deviation (positive or negative) as it does so. It also plots the data taken for each setpoint so that I can visually verify that it is operating as expected.
Based upon the program, I found that the most effective duty cycle for 30 C was 0.8%, and the most effective cycle for 60 C was 11%.
With these duty cycles, the maximum oscillation at 60 degrees was about 0.293 Celsius, and the maximum oscillation at 30 degrees was about 0.084 Celsius.
As this difference is pretty substantial, instead of using a uniform setpoint to achieve mediocre results across the board, I will use a linear interpolation between these points to use as duty cycles in the future problems.
